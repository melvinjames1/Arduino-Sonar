# SONAR Project

This Arduino project provides a simple guide to building a SONAR device at home from scratch. With some basic components and Arduino knowledge, you can create your own SONAR system.

## Requirements:

1. **Arduino Uno (or other compatible models):** The heart of the project, responsible for controlling the SONAR system.

2. **Connecting Wires:** Essential for connecting various components together on the breadboard.

3. **Breadboard:** Provides a platform for easily prototyping and connecting electronic components.

4. **Servo Motor:** Used for controlling the direction of the ultrasonic sensor.

5. **Ultrasonic Sensor:** The sensor responsible for emitting ultrasonic waves and detecting their reflections to measure distance.

## Circuit Setup:

1. Connect the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.

2. Connect the GND pin of the ultrasonic sensor to any GND pin on the Arduino.

3. Connect the Trig pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital any vecant pin on the Arduino.

4. Connect the Echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital any vecant pin on the Arduino.

5. Connect the signal wire of the servo motor to digital any vecant pin on the Arduino.

6. Connect the power (usually red) and ground (usually brown) wires of the servo motor to the 5V and GND pins on the Arduino respectively.
